**CSV Files** - A CSV file (Comma Separated Values file) is a type of plain text file that uses specific structuring to arrange tabular data. Because it's a plain text file, it can contain only actual text dataâ€”in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters. The structure of a CSV file is given away by its name.
