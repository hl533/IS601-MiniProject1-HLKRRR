# using the tab key to complete file paths

Tab completion is an extremely helpful feature in nearly any command-line environment, whether you’re using the Bash shell on Linux, Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or a terminal window on Mac OS X.

 

This feature can dramatically help you speed up typing commands. Just hit Tab while typing a command, option, or file name and the shell environment will automatically complete what you’re typing or suggest options to you.

 

## Tab Completion on Linux

 

For example, let’s say you want to run the  **firefox**  command. You can just type  **fir**  or  **fire**  into the terminal and press Tab — if your system doesn’t have any other commands that begin with those letters, Bash will automatically fill in  **firefox**  and you can press Enter to run the command.

 

As another example, let’s say you want to run one the Apt package manager’s commands. You can type  **apt-**  and press Tab twice to see a list of commands beginning with apt-. To run one of the commands, continue typing it and press Tab again — for example, we could type a  **g,** press Tab, and  **apt-get**  would appear.

Tab completion is especially useful when typing file names, directories, and paths. Rather than trying to type a long file name that may involve spaces and special characters you’ll need to properly escape, you can just start typing the beginning of the name and press Tab.

 

For example, if we have a long, complex file name beginning with the letter L, we’d just have to type  **L**  and press Tab to automatically complete it. If we had multiple file names beginning with L, we’d just need to type a bit more of the file’s name before pressing Tab again.

Tab completion can even be used to automatically complete options for some commands. For example, when installing a package with the  **apt-get install**  command, you can use tab completion to automatically complete a package’s name. This also helps you search for related packages, and is very useful when you’re not sure exactly what a package is named.

 

Try using tab completion with other commands to see what you can and can’t automatically complete.

Bash also supports other types of completion. For example, you can type a  **~**  and press Tab to automatically complete a user name, type an  **@**  and press Tab to automatically complete a host name, or type a  **$**  and press Tab to automatically complete a variable.
