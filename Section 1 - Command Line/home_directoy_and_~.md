# Home directory and ~

The tilde ~ is a Linux "shortcut" to denote a user's home directory. Thus tilde slash (~/) is the beginning of a path to a file or directory below the user's home directory.

 

For example, for user01, file  `/home/user01/test.file`  can also be denoted by  `~/test.file`.

 

That construct can be used in Linux commands, for example:  `ls -al ~/test.file`

 

Note: Quite often, the succeeding file or directory name is preceded by a  **period**  (".") which indicates that it is hidden (in Linux).
