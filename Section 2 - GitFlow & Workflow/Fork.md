# Fork -
>“There are two primary ways people collaborate on GitHub:
> - Shared repository
> - Fork and pull
>
>With a shared repository, individuals and teams are explicitly designated as contributors with read, write, or administrator access. This simple permission structure, combined with features like protected branches and Marketplace, helps teams progress quickly when they adopt GitHub.
For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can contribute, managing individual permissions can be challenging, but a fork and pull model allows anyone who can view the project to contribute. A fork is a copy of a project under an developer’s personal account. Every developer has full control of their fork and is free to implement a fix or new feature. Work completed in forks is either kept separate, or is surfaced back to the original project via a pull request. There, maintainers can review the suggested changes before they’re merged.”

By forking, a contributor essentially duplicates an existing repo into their own GitHub repository, allowing them to freely work on an open-source project or any other project that they can view, without needing to have explicit permission/rights management on the original project. The contributor can then update their ‘forked’ repo through pull requests from the original project, or suggest changes to the 'master' project through pull requests that have to be approved and reviewed by the project ‘maintainers’.
