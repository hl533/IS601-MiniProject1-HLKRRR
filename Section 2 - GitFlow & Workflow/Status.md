# Status - 

>The `git status` command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git. Status output does _not_ show you any information regarding the committed project history.

In short, it's a very basic function that just shows you which files have been staged or unstaged or untracked. Depending on what the result is, ```git add``` or ```git commit```may be the next appropriate command.

The command to get the Git status is simply:
```git status```
