# Master Branch - 

>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is  `master`. As you start making commits, you’re given a  `master`  branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the  `master`  branch pointer moves forward automatically.

>The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch. The only reason nearly every repository has one is that the  `git init`  command creates it by default and most people don’t bother to change it.

By consensus, the master branch is the one that is the main one where all the development branches branch from and is often the deployment branch. If a project can be thought of as a tree, the master branch is the trunk, and all other branches can be traced back to it.
