# Commit –

>“Once your branch has been created, it's time to start making changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch.
>
>Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you've done and why. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Furthermore, each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction.

>Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.”

A commit is a “snapshot’ of the state of the project or the work you’ve done, and allow for very clear and explicit descriptions of the changes made, why, and allow anyone to understand the work that was done and either implement the change or revert it as necessary.
