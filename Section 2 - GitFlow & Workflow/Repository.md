# Repository –

> “A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of
> files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s
> revision history.
> 
> Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and
> anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire
> codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use
> interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the
> history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing
> changes across versions of code, and more.
> 
> Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and
> protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh
> features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git
> facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight
> pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and
> deprecated when no longer needed.
> 
> Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities
> for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help
> teams work together to build the best possible final product.”

Here is an example of what a repository may look like, displaying the commits and branches in graphical form:

Here's what the main page for the repository you're currently in right now looks like:
